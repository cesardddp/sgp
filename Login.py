# The class that you use to represent users needs to implement these properties and methods:


# is_authenticated
# This property should return True if the user is authenticated, i.e. they have provided valid credentials. (Only authenticated users will fulfill the criteria of login_required.)
# is_active
# This property should return True if this is an active user - in addition to being authenticated, they also have activated their account, not been suspended, or any condition your application has for rejecting an account. Inactive accounts may not log in (without being forced of course).
# is_anonymous
# This property should return True if this is an anonymous user. (Actual users should return False instead.)

        To make implementing a user class easier, you can inherit from UserMixin, which provides default implementations for all of these properties and methods. (Itâ€™s not required, though.)
